TkDisplay - Tracker event display on Qt4/OpenGL/ROOT

                                    13/06/2009 by SH

* The performance and the looking is optimized for Qt4.5 on Mac OSX Leopard

* It is recommended to run this application on the local machine.
  Running on a remote machine through X11 forwarding 
  will make the performance too slow. 
  You can change the animation at the Box:Animation in Tab:Style.


Softwares needed:
(1) Qt >= 4.3.0 (>= 4.5.1 recommended)
(2) ROOT        (>= v5.21 recommended)
(3) Gbatch ntuple library made with "make lib" and "PGTRACK" option

 Qt4 is available at http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads


How to install:
(1) Set following environment variables
 ROOTSYS  : directory where root is installed
 QTDIR    : directory where Qt4 is installed
 PGTRACK  : needed to refer Gbatch code in PGTRACK mode
 path     : $ROOTSYS/bin and $QTDIR/bin should be included

(2) Open "tkdisplay.pro" and check if "LIBS" is correctly set
    especially check if the path to the Gbatch ntuple library 
    (e.g. libntuple_slc4.a) is correct

(3) Run "qmake" to generate Makefile and then "make"
