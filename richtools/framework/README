Analysis framework
-------------------

Current directory contains an initial analysis framework for AMS root files
containing AMSRoot trees.

The framework itself consists in two include files: AnalysisFramework.h  simplify.h. 

Provided is an example which reads the files and creates a dst for further analysis. This 
examples consists in files RichMass.C and dst.C. In order to compile a standalone version
of the analysis use the provided script "compila". To run it within root use the root macro
start.C (by issuing .x start.C in root). 

The example assumes that the PG shared library have been built, and that the AMS
source code directory is pointed by the AMSWD environment variable. If this is not the
case, it is possible to run them in ams machines by doing

setenv AMSWD /Offline/vdev

in csh kind of shells or

export AMSWD=/Offline/vded

in bash ones prior to run.
