                 General structure of ECAL calibration parameters.
		    
    There are 3 types of calib.files created by ECAL-calibration procedures:
 RLGA(channels relative gains), FIAT(fibers attenuation length) and ANOR
 (absolute normalization). The offline reconstruction program can read these
 files directly or use calibration information from DataBase (this info have
 to be put there in advance using special DB-update mode of standard offline
 reconstruction program).
    This set of 3 files is referenced using file EcalCflistMC.N or 
 EcalCflistRD.***** (respectively for MC and RD (real data) data types).
 Here N is the MC version number, ***** is 1st run number used to extract
 calibration data. Offline reconstruction program use this ref.file to read
 related set of RLGA,FIAT and ANOR files. The version number is defined by
 data card ECMC 29=N for MC-data and by card ECRE 35=***** for RD.

    EcalCflistMC.N file has the following format:

    There are 2 sub-types of MC calib.files (for RLGA and FIAT types):
  Seed (SD) and MC. SD is used at digitization stage (simulation), MC is
  used at reconstruction stage of standard offline program. MC files are the
  output ones of related calibration procedures applied to MC-events generated
  using corresponding SD files. Parameters in SD-files should be close to
  real parameters of ECAL, so one can use hands made copy of corresponding RD
  calibration files as SD-files. The SD and MC files can be the same if you
  want to neglect by calibration procedures accuracy. The choise of SD/MC-files
  as "Seed" can be controlled by data card ECMC 5=1/0(sd/mc).

	----------------------------------------------------
            (ceate RLGA and FIAT types of calib.files)

 Algorithm:
 
1.    Track preselection (good chi2, track hits ECAL(with some safety gap),
   Z>=2(or Z=1 if MIP mode was activated)

2. Punch-through event selection:

   Event is removed (non PunchThrough) if contains more than N (0)
     bad SubCell(pixel) planes. Plane is bad if:
       a) more than 2 fired (ADC >ADCmin(3.)) pixels/plane;
       b) OR two fired pixels are not neigbouring;
       c) OR there is at least one pixel with Edep>ADCmax(1000.)
     
     For accepted event: N(1) ScPlanes with Highest Edep are marked as bad.
   In further analysis any SuperLayer containing such bad plane is ignored.
   Truncated(by above procedure) Edep shoud correspond Z=2(1).
   
   Note: All above cuts on ECAL-signals are applied to EcalHits(converted 
   back to ADC counts). It means we use parameters from previous calibration 
   (EcalRawEvent-hits were converted to EcalHits using this calibration). 
   This is done to improve preselection efficiency(gains variations are 
   already corrected in first approximation).
   
    The next steps are applied already to EcalRawEvent hits !!! (any kind of 
    calibration is not applied !!!)
   
   
3. Loop over ECAL SuperLayers doing :
   
    a) crossing of track with superlayer:
    b) finding the PM which is crossed by track (with big safety gap 
       to compensate track impact point accuracy)
    c) finding the SubCells(pixels) which are crossed by Track(again with 
       some safety gap (SL/Rigidity-dependent due to multiple scattering ?);
       all crossed cells are counted.
    d) finding (among the crossed cells) fired ones (with threshold ADCmin).
       PM is considered as crossed/fired if it contains at least one 
       crossed/fired pixel.
       
       The signals of fired cells are summed. PM signals are summed separately
       for different positions (along the fiber) of track impact point.
       
       
4. After event loop:

    a) PM and SubCell(pixel) signal-sums are normalized by corresponding 
       crossings(!!!) counters (to have efficiency involved); 
    
    b) PM relative gains(with respect to RefPM) are calculated using only
       central area of fiber length. The PM-signal dependence on the impact 
       point position is used to calculate light attenuation parameters (only
       for left/center/right PM's in each SL). It is implied to use this  
       info for study of long time effects in fiber behavior.
	 
    c) 4-SubCell relative gains are calculated for each PM (with respect 
       to total PM-responce calculated as sum of 4 indiv. pixels).
       
       
5.   During the event loop for each pixel the LowGainChannel ADC-signals are 
   summed as function of HighGainChannel ADC-signal value. At the end of run
   the straight line fit is performed to extract High-to-Low-gain ratio for 
   each channel (pixel).
   
      The program creates 2 files: EcalRlgaMC(RD).N(runN) and 
   EcalFiatMC(RD).N(runN)(if was requested by ECRE 5=2).
     
      
                     ANOR(abs.normalization) calibration.
		    --------------------------------------

 Algorithm:
 
      The absolute calibration of ECAL is done in separate procedure 
   using information from above RLGA/FIAT-calibration. This procedure must include
   real clustering algorith (used at the reconstruction stage) to include the
   possible leakage effects (to be done).
      The calibration is done with preselected electrons in momentum range
   3-15gev/c and calculate abs.norm.parameter requiring Mom/Ecal ratio to
   be 1.
   
   1.   Check that Anti-counter has not more than 1 fired sector;
   
   2.   Track preselection (good chi2, small half track rigidities assimetry,
      correct sign of curvature, track hits ECAL, ...);
      
   3.   Hits pattern in SubCells(pixel) layers is analysed to suppress early 
      showering events or event with abnormal activity (spikes or too high 
      multiplicity)in any plane;
     
   4.   Suppression of events with big Side/Back energy leakage;
   
   5.   "Electromagneticity" check by analysing Efront/Epeak/Etail ratious;
   
   6.   Check Ebackground/Esignal ratio in first 6 planes (Esignal is total
      energy of SubCells around track crossing point(closer than some distance),
      Ebackgr - the energy of the rest in plane);
        This check is not activated by default now but may be used as addition
      or replacement to item 3 cut using flag ECRE 6=0/1/2(see datacards.doc); 
      
   7.   For first 6 planes check that COG is close to track crossing point;
   
   8.   For selected events accumulate Mom/Ecal ratious and fit this distribution
       by gaussian. Calculate new abs.norm.factor using previous(old) one and 
       deviation of most prob. ratio from 1.
       
        Sistematic error of such calibration is about 1% (dependence of ratio on
     energy in the range 3-15 gev/c). Result of abs. calibration is saved in
     file EcalAnorMC(RD).N(runN) as adc2mev conversion factor.
     
     	Related Data cards (ECCA) are explained in datacards.doc file.
