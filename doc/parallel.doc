parallelizing of AMS code

 
Goal:
-----------

Parallelization of gbatch.exe on the event level with dynamic thread number 
using  openmp protocol

Parallelization of the root code enabling reading root chains parallel on the file level (not yet implemented)

see eg  https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/



Compiler:
------------

intel icc/ifc version 11 (openmp 3.0 support)

http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/docs/clin/main_cls/index.htm

NB openmp 3.0 ext are not using for the moment


Compiling:
-----------
define AMSP 1
gmake -j


Current Status
--------------

a. 

gbatch.exe/gbatch_orbit.exe seems to be run without problem and has ~ 90% thread efficiency with chunk_number 1000000 , ~ 85% with chunk_number 4000 events  

(means 680-720% on 8 core machine) w/r to the non threaded one.


number of threads changeable with MISC 8=thread_number (default 1) 9=dynamic_update (!sometimes gives omp_abort , should be not switched on) (default 0) 10=chunk_number (default 4096)  
changeable dynamically via openmp w/r host load or manually with signals TTOU (-1) or TTIN (+1) or TSTP (num_of_proc)





b. Issues to be resolved:

None

c. To be done:


Check  Level1 Trigger 

Fix all histos call by adding #pragma omp critical /up to developpers/

Fix all calibration issues  /up to developpers/

Check gbatch  in monitoring mode
