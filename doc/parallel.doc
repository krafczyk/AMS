parallelizing of AMS code

 
Goal:
-----------

Parallelization of gbatch.exe on the event level with dynamic thread number 
using  openmp protocol

Parallelization of the root code enabling reading root chains parallel on the file level 

see eg  https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/



Compiler:
------------

intel icc/ifc version 11 (openmp 3.0 support)

http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/docs/clin/main_cls/index.htm

NB openmp 3.0 ext are not using for the moment


Compiling:
-----------
define AMSP 1
gmake -j


Current Status
--------------

a. 

gbatch.exe/gbatch_orbit.exe seems to be run without problem and has ~ 1.6% per thread cpu inefficiency. This translates to     
performance up to 760% on 8 core machine w/r to the non threaded one.
In case dynamic thread allocation with chunk_number=4096  elapsed performance is slightly degraded by ~ 3-5%    


number of threads changeable with MISC 8=thread_number (default 1) 9=dynamic_update (!sometimes gives omp_abort , should be not switched on) (default 0) 10=chunk_number (default 8192)  
changeable dynamically via openmp w/r host load or manually with signals TTOU (-1) or TTIN (+1) or TSTP/URG (num_of_proc)




NB  Due to (?) the performance   degrades rapidly with the thread number if the latter is >  number of processors. E.g. 16 threaded job  on 8 core machine will have performace degradation per thread of factor of 16 and not 2 as one can (naively) expect.




b. Issues to be resolved:

None

c. To be done:




Fix all calibration issues  /up to developpers/



d. Linking

under SLC4 /obsolete/ creates exec with many procecesses 
under fedora 8,9, SLC5 creates exec with one mthreaded process  /recommended/
