a.  No  changes in AMS software structure are allowed without approval of the  AMS software coordinator and/or his deputy.   Same is applicable for any root file structure changes.  In general, changes should be limited with the particular subdetector software the author work with. Trivial exception from this rule is the bug fxinig.

b.   BEFORE to commit the changes the author must ensure:

      cd AMS/install 
      gmake ,gmake gxint , gmake shared   are ok with:

      icc +ifc
      gcc +icc
      gcc +g77
    
      gmake producer -i  is ok 
        icc+ifc
        gcc+ifc

      gmake server is ok with 
        gcc+ifc
      
      cd display,online
        gmake, gmake osdepend are ok 

c. Run the produced images /except the server one/ and ensure everythig is ok.
d.  Load the shared library ibid.  



The details of compiler/builds are:



The icc/gcc compilers as well the linux version as installed on pcamsf2.cern.ch and/or pcamsp1.cern.ch


The root version as pointed by /Offline/vdev/install/amsvar (icc)
and /Offline/vdev/install/amsvar.slc4 (gcc)

currently (from today) the root version is to 5.21

online.slc4 and display.slc4 are now obsolete, as we don;t support slc3 anymore.


There are 3 basic flavours of gbatch build:
cd AMS/install
gmake
gmake shared
gmake gxint
gmake producer
gmake server


a. icc 10.1.12 + ifc 10.1.12 + ifc 7.00 .  The latter is needed because cernlib was compiled with it.

 activates by:
     setenv AMSICC 1
     source /Offline/vdev/install/amsvar

 features:
     fastest exec
     requires intel db to debug (not tested!)
     gmake server doesn;t work
     gmake producer requires -i 


b. gcc 3.4.x + ifc 7.00
activates by:
     setenv AMSICC 1
     source /Offline/vdev/install/amsvar.slc4



 features:
   
     requires gdb to debug. fortran routines coiuld not be debug.
     gmake server works.
  


c. gcc/g77 3.4.x  

   activates by:
     unsetenv AMSICC 
     source /Offline/vdev/install/amsvar.slc4




 features:
     
     requires gdb to debug. fortran routines could be debugged.
   
  

There is only one set of display /online bulid

source /Offline/vdev/install/amsvar

cd AMS/display{online}

gmake 
gmake osdepend
