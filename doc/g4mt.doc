//  Geant4 Multithreading + ams software parallelization

Release notes

1.only icc 15 openmp version is supported


2. Minimal software change: using G4 Threading model + amssoftware basically as it is, with few exceptions:


  thread id, number of threads and number of cores  are taken from geant4 , not from openmp


  some openmp pragmas not working barrier, master,parallel (therefore no copyin directives)

  openmp locks are not working

   

  Barriers were emulated using AMSEvent::SetBarrier

  all other omp pragmas are working (sic!)  atomic,critical,threadprivate etc





3. To build  use  /afs/cern.ch/ams/Offline/vdev/install/build410_mt.sh


4. /afs/cern.ch/ams/Offline/vdev/examples/g4mt.job part nthreads is runing example

   To activate multithreading  use  MISC 8=nthreads datacards

 

// Features

the events in the root file will be not ordered by default (MISC 29=0 will change this with some /may be big/  memory penalty), however amschain getentryordered can be used to get the ordered events


RNDM hase still no reproducibility, to be worked in , however it does not change quality of results

Number of threads can not be changed dynamically, g4 fault .



DAQ file writing not ordered (currently not possible to order it via datacard, to be work out)

//Performance

 memory use ~ 1.5 gb+0.1gb*nthr 
vmemory use  ~ 2.5 gb+0.25gb*thr
Practical example:  72 thread jobs vmemory < 20 gb memory < 10 gb
