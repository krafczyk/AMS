//  Geant4 Multithreading + ams software openmp

only icc 15 openmp version is supported

using G4 Threading model + amssoftware basically as it is, with few exceptions.


   thread id is taken from geant4 , not from openmp


 openmp pragmas not working:

 barrier, master,parallel (therefore no copyin directives)

openmp locks are not working

barrier was emulated using AMSEvent::SetBarrier


//Status

to compile setenv G4MULTITHREADING 1

or use vars in /Offline/vdev/install/build410_mt.sh

 examples/g4mt.job is runing example

to activate multithreading  use same MISC=nthr datacards
//TBD
 
RNDM not checked /no reproducibility, to be worked in /

Number of threads can not be changed dynamically /may be changed in the future//

// Features

the events in the root file will be not ordered by default (MISC 29=0 will change this with some memory penalty), however amschain getentryordered can be used to get the ordered events

richlip reconstruction not working (common blocks need to be fixed by authors)

//Performance

 memory use ~ 1 gb+0.1gb*nthr 

 scalability  sec per event /protons 100 to 200 gev/
