//  Geant4 Multithreading + ams software openmp

only icc 15 openmp version is supported

using G4 Threading model + amssoftware basically as it is, with few exceptions.


   thread id is taken from geant4 , not from openmp


 openmp pragmas not working:

 barrier, master,parallel (therefore no copyin directives)

openmp locks are not working
openmp functions lke omp_get_thread_num and others are not working

barrier was emulated using AMSEvent::SetBarrier

all other omp pragmas are working (sic!)  atomic,critical,threadprivate etc

//Status

to compile setenv G4MULTITHREADED 1

or use vars in /Offline/vdev/install/build410_mt.sh

 examples/g4mt.job is runing example

to activate multithreading  use same MISC=nthr datacards
//TBD
 

// Features

the events in the root file will be not ordered by default (MISC 29=0 will change this with some /may be big/  memory penalty), however amschain getentryordered can be used to get the ordered events


RNDM hase still no reproducibility, to be worked in , however it does not change quality of results

Number of threads can not be changed dynamically /may be changed in the future//




DAQ File Writing not ordered (currently not possible to order it via datacard, to be work out)

//Performance

 memory use ~ 1.5 gb+0.1gb*nthr 
vmemory use  ~ 2.5 gb+0.25gb*thr
Practical example:  72 thread jobs vmemory < 20 gb memory < 10 gb
