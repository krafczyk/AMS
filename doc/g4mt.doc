//  Geant4 Multithreading + ams software parallelization

Release notes

1.only icc 15 openmp version is supported


2. Minimal software change: using G4 Threading model + amssoftware basically as it is, with few exceptions:


  thread id, number of threads and number of cores  are taken from geant4 , not from openmp


  some openmp pragmas not working barrier, master,parallel (therefore no copyin directives)

  openmp locks are not working

  DPMJET2.5  required heavy patch

   

  Barriers were emulated using AMSEvent::SetBarrier

  all other omp pragmas are working (sic!)  atomic,critical,threadprivate etc





3. To build  use  /afs/cern.ch/ams/Offline/vdev/install/build410_mt.sh


4. /afs/cern.ch/ams/Offline/vdev/examples/g4mt.job part nthreads 
    is running example

   To set number of threads    use  MISC 8=nthreads datacard

 

// Features

the events in the root file will be not ordered by default (MISC 29=x0 will change this with some /may be big/  memory penalty), however amschain AMSChain::GetEntryOrdered(unsigned long long entry)  can be used to get the ordered events


RNDM hase still no reproducibility, to be worked in , however it does not change quality of results

Poissn distribution rndm  idoes not exist in geant4.10++ ,  CLHEP one is used instead, here breaking the thread safety and reproducibility (once again)  

Number of threads can not be changed dynamically, g4 fault .



DAQ file writing is ordered by default
