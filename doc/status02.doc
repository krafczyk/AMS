 30   event has errors

 31   status not found



correspondance between bits & status datacards words:

values 0123...etc --> 1 10 100 1000    (in fact base ESTA 34)
                      0 in datacards means select everything




N.B.

Due to lack of bits there is no "undefined state" bits,
so to ensure proper functionality one has to require 
particle (datacards: ESTA 1=1110) for most other status bits
