========================================================
DPMJET provide simulation of ion with different targets. 
Geant4 nucleus code don't provide detailed spectra for projectile energy above 10GeV/n
however DPMJET fortran codes can cover 5GeV/n-1000TeV/n.FORTRAN code of DPMJET-2.5 is 
developed by J.Ranft for FLUKA. The interface to Geang4 was developed by P.Truscott. 
The Modification version to be compatible with AMSsoft is released.

1.3  KONWN ISSUE
========================================================
If switch IonPhysicsModel=3, for Kinetic energy <5GeV/n, G4BinaryLightIonReaction Model will be active.
For Kinetic Energy >5GeV/n, DPMJET Model will be used instead.

Currently DPMJET-CrossSection data only support nucleus number up to AT(Traget)=58 AP(Projectile)=58.

1: For inject paricle nuclus number AP>58(Ni), this model is not supported due to lack of data
2: For high A detector(AT>58), such as AMSEcal Pb,
G4IonsShenCrossSection(CrossSection) and G4BinaryLightIonReaction(Model) will be used in high energy range for those material.
Ion fragment simulation maybe not so accurate in high energy(>10GeV) for high AT(>58) material.
