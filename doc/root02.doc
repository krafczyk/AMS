Guidance for the root classes design:


Unless absolutely necessarily:
No inheritance
Only 4-byte floats and integer vars
stl vectors for var arrays
(multi)dim arrays for fixed arrays
references via integer indexing
all aux classes should be defined inside root.h (no external include files )


Naming conventions (NO EXCEPTIONS)

root class name must end with R
reference vector and variable names should start with f. 
functions which return pointers to objest xyzR should be declared
xyzR * pxyz(index    ); where index may be null, unsigned int or char as needed 
---                    indexes    ---------
int ixyz(index);
functions return number of elements of obj xyz should be declared
int Nxyz() const;

each class should have char * Info(int) function which returns human reaable string of  object content
 
different reconstruction algorithms for the same  functional objects should provide
their own object names, so the object can be created in parallel with but not limited to debugging purposes.
