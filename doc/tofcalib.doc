     The following "on-data"-calibration procedures are developed upto now:
 
1) STRR-calibration:
     stretcher_ratio/offset calculation for every of 112 channels
     using the parametrization Tout=p1+p2*Tin, p1 - offset, p2 - stretcher
     ratio;
     
2) AVSD-calibration:
     Calculation of Dynode/Anode-correlation parameters; used parametrization
     is dTdyn=p1+p2*dTan, where dTdyn and dTan are Dynode and Anode
     "time_over_threshold", p1 - offset due to lower gain of dynode,
     p2 - correlation factor (slope);

3) TDIF-calibration:
     calculate "0" time-difference and eff. light velocity for
     each of 56 TOF-counters ("0" means two side time difference for
     particles with "0" impact point (center))
     
4) TZSL-calibration:
     To calculate T0's for each of 56 counters and common (for 56 counters) 
     slope in T=(t1+t2)/2 vs (1/Qa1+1/Qa2) dependence (slewing correction);
     This procedure needs at least momentum measurement from tracker;
     In principal, individual slewing corrections may be used by reco-program,
     in this case calibration procedure for common slope(should be =1) may
     gives info about common drift of indiv. slewing corrections; 
     
5) AMPL-calibration:
     To calculate relative (wrt ref.bar in each counter size-group) gains
     (each side), position correction (for each ref.bar) and abs. normali-
     zation (mip->pC) (for each ref.bar);
     This procedure needs at least momentum measurement from tracker and
     all previous TOF calibration already done.
     
       The items 3. may be repeated (after item 4. was done) if "slewing 
  correction" option was used during the run.
       Any recalibration for any item should be followed by recalibration of
  all items below (with some small exeptions which should be selected very
  carefully).
       The items 1-2 are made during one run (when corresponding flag was
  selected).
       The outputs from different calibration items are ASCII files filled with
  corresponding parameters. The data from these files should be combined into
  few final calibration files by hahds (after carefull check on "reasonability").
  
       These final (read by Program and used by DB) calibration files are:
       
    a) srscalibNNmc.dat/srscalibMMrl.dat for MC/REAL-data, where NN/MM are the
       version numbers. This srscalib... file combine info from STRR-calibration
       and status of each channel (alive/dead(noisy)) - see explanation inside
       the file. Stretcher parameters may be also takef from Bolognia test measu-
       rements.
       
    b) incalibNNmc.dat/incalibMMrl.dat for MC/REAL-data. These files contain
       anode-integrator parameters (average "over_all_channels" values for MC)
       and dynode-integrator parameters (....................................).
       The anode parameters are taken FROM BOLOGNIA GROUP (test-setup measurements),
       the dynode parameters may be taken from AVSD-calibration or again from
       BOLOGNIA GROUP.
       
    c) tzcalibNNmc.dat/tzcalibMMrl.dat files contain average light speed and "0" 
       time-differences (output from TDIF-calibration). These files contain also
       slewing correction (common for all channels slope) and T0's for each bar.
       This set is output from TZSL-calibration. Currently individual slewing
       corrections (if needed at al) may be introduced "by hands" into this
       file (default values are now equal to 1 to permit TZSL-calibration to run
       in old=common_slope mode). If indiv. slewing corrections are provided from
       external source and put in this file, then default value for common slope 
       should be set to 1. TZSL-calibration may by run again to give some "common" 
       slope correction (about 1 if indiv. slopes have something to do with reality).
       
    d) ancalibNNmc.dat/ancalibMMrl.dat files contain now individual anode_to_dinode
       ratios (these are used only by MC because for REAL events the Contin's
       parametrization is used currently for dinodes (it includes already an_to_dyn 
       ratio). These files contain also relative (to ref.bar) channel gains, impact
       point corrections (for ref. bars) and abs.calibration factors (for ref.bars).
       These 3 sets of parameters are taken from AMPL-calibration output.
       The procedure for Position_correction calibration is not yet finished, so the
       reconstruction of real events use temporarily MC position_corrections.
       
       The version numbers NN/MM for each kind of final calibration files to be read
       are defined inside of tofverlistKK.dat file which is read first at the 
       beginning of program initialization phase. The version number KK of this file
       is defined by datacard TOFCA 28 and is in the range 01-99 (def.value=1)
