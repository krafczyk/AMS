Compile Time
-------------

1. mceventg.C should be compiled with -g option on aix&hpux
2. makedepend does not work on sgi


Run Time
----------
1. AMSgSen::getsenstrip-S-Error.  
   Probably geant tracking bug. Happens rarely.

2. The event sequences for OSF1 & AIX are different.
   Probably due to different geant tracking.

1. ooddlx (DDL processor) complains about definition of 
               extern     int      class(double);
  in /usr/include/math.h 

   workaround :

-  the real problem is the two versions of most .h files under
   AIX. They have /usr/include/math.h (which is not directly parseble by
   xlC and ooddlx and /usr/lpp/xlC/include/math.h (which #includes the
   former one after some redefining some macros). For this reason you
   always have to  make sure that /usr/lpp/xlC/include/ is searched
   first by ooddlx. 
                                                                    
-  use files created by ooddlx on OSF1, they are machine independent

5. oonewfd (Objectivity task to create federated database) crashed if it is
   started without removing *.JNL files from the AMS/db/boot directory.
