   You are going to use TOF Calibration Commander - the graphic interface
 between the user and different TOF calibration procedures which use the
 standard offline reconstruction exec-file gbatch.exe comprising calibration
 related codes. First of all you should ssh to pcamsr0 computer (temporary
 limitation). CD to /f2users/tofaccuser/headquarters_new working directory.  
  
   The source files in  working /f2users/tofaccuser/headquarters_new directory
 are the copies of files in my /afs/cern.ch/user/c/choumilo/AMS/ut/tofcalut
 directory and can be updated only by me (temporary limitation).

 Do 'source /Offline/vdev/install/amsvar' command befor starting
 TofCommander (if this command not in your .login(or .tcshrc,...). This
 will set standard ams environment.
 
   To start session use StartTofCommander script (use 'StartTofCommander' 
 command). This script opens "Tof calibration Commander" window. At the 
 bottom/right side of the window there is the row of buttons(6 switches +
 "Start" and "Exit" buttons). You should click on one of the 6 switches 
 (selection of session type) and start selected session by clicking on 
 "Start". After that left side of the window is built in accordance with 
 selected session type, on right/top part of the window (messages area)
 you get welcome messages and can continue your session. Click "Help" for 
 introduction information. Most critical buttons have "right-click" help. 
 Read carefully the warning (beep + red color)  and usual messages on 
 log-screen - they can help you in many cases.
 
   DB-update  sessions require user name and password to do real job
 (ask me). For training purpose you can use "Guest" user name.
 In this case password is not required, but real DB-update will be blocked.
 
   The released version is preliminary, so some not critical buttons can
 be disactivated. Also help facilities are not completed. Inform me
 about any problems.
