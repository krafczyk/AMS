        Tof/Acc pedestals calibration session.
	
     It creates TOF|ACC-pedestals tables (ped-files) using
     Science Data (if in raw format) or OnBoard-created pedestals
     tables. 
   
     The program can perform the following actions:

    1) Scan standard AMS Daq-dirs and select all DAQ-files in 
       pre-defined dates(or run-numbers) range (it is implied
       that daq-files have file-extention equal to run-number,
       i.e. to UTC-time at the beginning of the run). Some
       limits are applied to length of the files and on some 
       other parameters by setting status (1->selected, 
       11->accepted) in the selected RunsList.
         You can re-run "ScanDaqDir" with modified dates range 
       based on info shown to you in "LogFileFrame" window.
         You can see all selected files info (RunList) and
       change the status selected<->accepted. Only runs with
       "accepted" status will be processed.
       
    2) Submit (file-by-file) standard TOF(ACC) pedcalib jobs
       to calculate ped_tables. As the result you have
       tofp(antp)_ds(tb)_rl.runnumber files and related 
       log-files written to working directory
       (/f2users/tofaccuser/headquarters_new/amsjobwd).
       
    3) If required, can give some info on the content of 
       ped_tables and their behaviour in the time (you need 
       to open special control pannel by clicking "Check").
       Based on the shown info you can exclude some of the
       selected files from the candidates (to DB-writing)
       list.
       
    4) To finish, you can click "Exit" to
       complete the procedure. The program will move 
       ped_table and ped_table_log files into /pedfiles
       directory and save general log-file under the name
       "PedCalcLogFile.xxxxxx" in /archive directory. The
       "xxxx" will be run-number of the 1st(earliest) 
       ped_table file successfully processed by the program. 
       
  The Program use the following entries for names of 
                                     directories and files:
  
       "AmsD"  - according to your current "env" definition
                 of standard path to AMSDataDir directory.
       "WorkD" - path to standard SubDetector-calibration
                 working directory.
       "PedfD" - path to standard directory where the 
                 ped_table files are stored befor writing
		 to DB (sub-dir of "WorkD").
       "ArchD" - path to standard directory where the
                 DB-written ped_table files are moved to
		 (currently sub-dir of "PedfD").
       "DaqF"  - Single daq-file name (Run-numner) to be 
                 processed (default is all files found in 
		 the defined dates/runs window).
		 
  The standard buttons sequence for the session is :
     "Tof(Acc)PedCalc"->"DataTrig/BoardTable"->
     "RunNumner(RunDate)"->"ScanDaqDir"->["EditRList"]->
     "StartJob"->Wait->["Check"(see plots, remove bad file)]
     ->"Exit".
     
     
  The particular buttons description is shown below:
      
    "ScanDaqDir-Button:" 
                     scan AMS DAQ-files directories searching 
    for daq-file(s) in pre-defined low/high DATES/RunNumbers
    window. If low-boundary > high-boundary ALL files are 
    selected. If in the "DaqF" entry window default "All" was
    changed to particular daq-file run-number - only this 
    file will be searched for. The run-number sorted list of
    found files will be shown in LogFile-window and saved
    in memory (if particular file pass through some tests, its 
    status in memory is set to 11 (if not - to 1). After that
    the program stops and give you the announsement in red. 
    You can repeate scan with modified dates/runnumbers 
    window if nesessary.
    
    "EditRlist-Button:"
                     open window with the list of selected/
    accepted (status=1/11) daq-files. If you want to remove
    from processing some accepted files - click on related
    lines (they will be highlighted in yellow) and then
    click on "Exclude from processing" button. If you want
    to add some selected-only (status=1) files  - click on
    related lines and then click "Select for processing"
    button. When you finished - click on "Exit editor" 
    button.
    
    "StartJob-Button:"
                   start looping over the list of accepted
    daq-files and submit for every file the specially 
    compiled "gbatch"-job in pedestals-calibration mode 
    (mode is defined previously by "TofPedCalc/AccPedCal"-
    buttons and "RandTrig/DataTrig/BoardTable"-buttons). 
    Other run-parameter can be changed from default values 
    using related yellow entry-windows.  
    
    
    "QuitSess-Button:"
                   save full-history LogFile screen 
    into "Tof(Acc)PedCalcLogFile.xxxxxx." file, where 
    xxxxxx is the run number of the first(youngest) daq-file 
    successfully processed and not removed during the "check"
    stage. This file is moved to /pedfiles/archive directory.
    The program also moves ped_table/log files to /pedfiles
    directory (for later usage by TofAccPedDBWriter). Bad
    files are deleted. The list of all processed good files
    is saved into "Tof(Acc)DaqfHist_Data(Rand/OnBt).PEDC"-file
    to be used in the next session to define default search
    window (last procecced run+1 is used as left boundary
    of the search window).
    
    "StopJob/Check-Button:"
                    initially appears as orange "StopJob" to
    give user the possibility to interrupt the job (after 
    StartJob-button was clicked) if something goes wrong (you
    see, for example, bad diagnostics for every selected run
    because you forgot setenv AMSDataDir correctly or your 
    runs selection was not appropriate or ...). In this case
    you can change conditions (rescan daq-dir or just edit run
    list) and repeate "StartJob". In good case (no user 
    interruption, nonzero number of successfully processed runs)
    this button is changed to green "CheckJob" state. Clicking
    this button will open the control pannel for ped_table
    files quality control. Based on shown plots you can
    remove any of processed files from the list of 
    candidates for DB-updating.
    
    "ResetPlot-Button:"
                    resets points in the currently displayed
    plot. Particularly the SUBSEQUENT calls to the "Ped time-
    scan plot" plot will superimpose the new and old points,
    but the color for new ones will be changed (repetition
    period is 5) with each new fill.
    
    "NonEmpty/GoogStat-channels(%)-Button:"
                      plots time evolution of the portion(%)
    of NonEmpty/GoodStatus-channels in ped_table file
    (separately for anodes and dynodes). If these numbers 
    are too low - you can mark this file add remove it 
    by "Mark above file as bad"-button (to prevent 
    it later from writing to /pedfiles-dir on Exit-stage).
    
    "PedRmsTimeScanPlot-Button:"
                      plots time-evolution of Ped_Rms for
    particular channel LBBSP(BBS). Its value is shown in 
    yellow entry-window below (default value can be changed).
    Again you can click on any bad point to mark this file
    (its name appears in the lowest yellow entry window).
    Using the special "Mark above file as bad"-button below 
    you can mark this file as bad, i.e. it will not be 
    written to /pedfiles-dir. You can also see its log-file
    using "View above file JobLog"-button.
    
    "PedTimeScanPlot-Button:"
                      plots time evolution of ped and rms
    (+-5*rms is the height of the "point" and "middle of the
    point" position corresponds to the value of pedestal)
    for ONE particular channel (fill-in it in advance 
    according to the prompt, but do not remove the prompt 
    itself, or remove it completely !!!). If you see some 
    suspicious point (ped value and/or rms) click it and 
    the correcponding ped_table file name will appear in 
    the yellow entry area. Now you can look at all-channels 
    peds/rms values for this file if you click the next 
    button (see below). Or you can mark this file as bad.
    
    "OneFilePedsPlot-Button:"
                     plots all-channels peds for file name
    given in the yellow entry-area below this button.
    The dynode channels peds are plotted with its numbers
    as markers. 
      You can type-in another file name by hands or using the 
    "point-click" methode described in "PedTimeScan" plot.
