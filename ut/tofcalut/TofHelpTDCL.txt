       ==> This session creates Tof-TDC linearity calibration tables <==
               (short name TDCL -> TDC Linearity Calibration)
          
	  This type of calibration have to be done befor Tof-paddles
       time/amplitude uniformity (TAUC) calibration. This session
       submit jobs which create TofTdcorRD.xxxxx files in amsjobwd
       directory. This type of calibration files is 5th member
       of reference file TofCflistRD.MMM. Other 4 members are	  
       TofCstatRD.NNN, TofTdelvRD.NNN, TofTzslwRD.NNN and TofAmplfRD.NNN
       and they are created later in TAUC session. The TofCflist-file is 
       the reference file containing just NNN-references to above 5
       calibration file types. Here NNN(MMM) is run number of the first
       DAQ-file used in cabration procedure. Usually all NNN's are equal
       to MMM. The MMM have to be provided (through the related data-card)
       for any reconstruction Jobs if DataBase is not (can't be) used.
       This set is also used when you want to update TOF-related DataBase 
       records. Formally this calibration set (listed in TofCflistRD.MMM
       file) is valid ONLY for particular period of time (starting from run
       number NNN).   
       
		 
          The standard buttons sequence for the TAUC-session is :
	  
     ["LookAround"]->["ManualSess"]->"MgnetON/OFF"->"InSpace/OnEarth"
     ->"AllSFET"/"OneSFET"->"SetDefPars"->Redefine default params 
     in yellow windows (if nesessary)->"ScanDaqDir"->["EditRlist"]
     ->["EditJobScript"]->"SetupJob"->"SubmitJob"
           Now Job is sent to CERN LSF batch-job system...
     You can see job(s) status by clicking "CheckJobsStat". You can
     click "QuitSess" if don't want to wait the results (may take
     few hours if single CPU mode is used).
  
     
     
          The particular buttons description is shown below:

    "LookAround-Button:"
                     Shows all calib-files present in local
    ams working directory (the one where the submitted jobs temporary 
    put the output calib/log-files and where all reference calibration
    files are permanently stored);
                     Shows all log-files present in ams working
    directory (their presence indicates that some jobs submitted in
    present (or previous) sessions are completed.
                     shows the presence of submitted jobs in LSF
    queues and their status (running, pend etc);
    
    "ResetHistory-Button:"
                     Should be used with precautions, will ask you
    to confirm your desision;
                     After confirmation clear used DAQ-files history
    file (not fatal, program use this file to prompt you the DAQ-files
    range for the next job and for your actions monitoring);
                     Clear 'Submitted Jobs List'-file - may be useful
    to cleanup after few training/unsuccessful sessions;
                     Delete temporary DAQ-files 'link'-directories,
    be careful - submitted befor jobs can be destroid if untill this
    moment they still have 'pend'-status !!!
    
    "Manual/AutoSession-Switch:"
                     No immediate action;
                     Being switched to 'Auto' force (later) automatic
    submition of jobs withought clicking 'SubmitJob'-button. The
    maximum number of submitted jobs is limited by the number of
    found groups of DAQ-files with requested total statistics (the 
    list of DAQ-files is created later using 'ScanDaqDir'-button). 
    
    
    
    "SetDefPars-Button:"
                     Sets job default values in accordance with
    CalibMode selection, set default DAQ-files range based on 'Daq-files
    History'-file(if not empty, low limit  - last processed DAQ-file,
    high limit -> +2weeks);
                     Give you possibility to change default settings
    by typing relevante values in yellow entry-windows;
                     Activate next action button ('ScanDaqDir').
		     

    "RunNumber<=>Date-Button:"
                     Click it if you changed any default setting
    for search limits on DAQ-files run-numbers/dates. That action will
    convert RunNumber <=> RunDate values for each changed limit.
      
      
    "ScanDaqDir-Button:" 
                     Is activated only after you clicked 'SetDefPars'
    button;
		     Scan AMS DAQ-files directories searching  for
    daq-file(s) in pre-defined low/high RunNumbers(=Dates)
    window and satisfying some criteria (presence of all Tof/Trk 
    crates, more than minimal length of file and number of collected
    events per file). If low-boundary > high-boundary - ALL existing
    DAQ-files are selected. The run-numbers sorted list of found 
    files will be shown in LogFile-window and saved in memory (if 
    particular file pass through preselection criteria, its 
    status in memory is set to 11 (if not - to 1). After that
    the program stops and give you the announsement in red. 
    You can repeate scan with modified dates/runnumbers window
    if nesessary.
    
    "EditRlist-Button:"
                     Open window with the list of selected/
    accepted (status=1/11) daq-files. If you want to remove
    from processing some accepted files - click on related
    lines (they will be highlighted in yellow) and then
    click on "Exclude from processing" button. If you want
    to add some selected-only (status=1) files  - click on
    related lines and then click "Select for processing"
    button. When you finished - click on "Exit editor" 
    button.
    
    "SetupJob-Button:"
                   Based on list of selected (after scan)
    DAQ-files creates minimal group of files (really links) 
    with total statistics above or equal the requested one;  
                   Prepare final parameters set for 'near 
    standard' AMS Job-script;
      In 'AutoSession' mode :
                   Submits job (by calling job-script) and 
    repeat above actions untill the selected DAQ-files 
    list is completed (i.e. replace manual scan-setup-submit 
    sequence); 
                   After that puts the program in 'results 
    waiting state'(named WatchDog) with opened new window 
    (counters of running/finished jobs); 
                   Performs complete processing for each 
    finished job  - so you can go to sleep.
    
    
    "SubmitJob-Button:"
                  In "ManualSess"-mode submit job, save
    info about job (node, status, subm.time,...) in memory and
    special file and also inform user. In "AutoSess" mode is 
    not active. 
    
    
    "CheckJobsStat-Button:"
                   Open window and show the LSF-SYSTEM status of
    submitted jobs. If you click some line (particular job) in the
    right part of the window (line becomes yellow) and click 
    "Kill job" button -  the job will be removed from queue EVEN
    if it is still running. Log- and calib-files (if any) will be
    sent by LSF system to amsjobwd-directory. On "Quit JobControl"
    button click all this files will be removed and related
    link to used DAQ-files will be destroyed. List of submitted
    jobs (in memory and related file) will be updated.
    
    
    "JobOutpControl-Button:"
                   Open job output-files control window. Go through
    the list of submitted jobs and check their current status in
    LSF-queues. Mark missing (in queues) jobs as ended. Go through
    the amsjobwd directory and make the list of log-files. Inspect
    each log-file by comparing internal quality-table with reference
    values and set log-file status to bad/good state. Match list of
    log-files with SubmittedJobsList and set job status accordingly.
    Log-file info is shown in related column in right part of the
    window. You can select in this column any line and inspect in
    details the corresponding log-/err-files by clicking related
    buttons in top row of control-section (left par of the open
    window). List of all calib-files created by jobs is also
    shown in corresponding columns.
      "MatchFiles"-button checks consistency of calib- and log-files
    (by comparing of their creation times and run-number labels) and set
    new status (bad/good) in corresponding lists (seen in related
    columns in right part of the window). By selecting some line in
    TofTdcorRD column and clicking "AddNewRefSet" you create new Cflist
    file (new RefCalibSet) containing the reference to this new 
    TofTdcorRD.NNN-file, other references correspond to default Cflist
    file which was used in given session. This new RefCalibSet should
    be used in next TAUC calibration jobs as default RefCalibSet.
      "Cleanup"-button set unmatched or bad-quality files status to
    bad and delete temporary links to DAQ-files of finished jobs.
    New info is dsplayed in related columns.
      "Finish"-button PHYSICALLY delete bad log/cal-files and move
    good ones to store directory 'taucfiles'. Related job statuses
    are updated in SubmJobsList-file.       
    
    "QuitSess-Button:"
                    Save list of UNFINISHED jobs in file
    TofSubmJobsList.TDCL (to be used in next session of the same type).
    Create log-file with full history of your session (all messages 
    which you normally see on top/right side of the window) and move 
    it to store (taucfiles directory). The left/top (session type 
    related) part of the screen is removed (after some delay to let
    you see 'quit'-stage messages) and session type selection switches
    are again activated. You can start new session or click "Exit".
