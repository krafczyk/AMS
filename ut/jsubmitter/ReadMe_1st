             ***** Short introduction *****
		     
   The offline program (gbatch) has many data cards to modify default behaviour. 
 In some situations (subdetector codes development, debugging, private root files creation,...)
 you need to do a lot of manipulations with data cards, frequently inquire for files like 
 datacards.doc,job.C,... As a consequence you have big probability to make a mistake. 
 Proposed graphics interface simplify this task, helps to create reproducible results and 
 simplify management of output data and jobs submisions. Clearly it is not any kind of 
 replacement to Vitali's Production Remote client system. 
   The construction of this interface is not finished, particularly specific data cards
 of TRK,TRD and RICH are not implemented, but i already used this interface on pcamsr0 and 
 pcamsn0 machines for practical purposes working with TOF,ACC,EC specfic cards and general
 ones (it means usage of default settings in TRK,TRD and RICH cards). To continue the 
 development more effectively and implement more data cards i need some feedback, first 
 of all from TOF,ACC and EC peoples. This is the aim of current pre-release.
 
            ***** How to install *****
      
    You should "setenv" for some working directories :
      MyCVSTopDir  as, for example, /afs/cern.ch/user/c/'person'/AMS 
                                              (your top directory for EXISTING AMS CVS tree)
      MyJobSubmDir as /f2users/'person'/jobsubmwd
                                              (top directory to work with JobSubmitter)
      MyRootfDir  as  /f2users/'person'/rootfiles
                                              (top directory to store your private root files)
      MyMCDaqfDir as  /f2users/'person'/mcdaqfiles
                                              (top directory to store your mc-daq files)
  (of course it may be not /f2users/... but /scratch or something else). I put these definitions
  in my .login file for convenience.  Other sub-directories (like amsjobwd, rd(mc)logfiles,...)
  will be created automatically during installation procedure.
   
    So steps are:
    
     'cd' to your MyCVSTopDir/ut/jsubmitter
     
     run 'JobSubmitInstaller' script
     
     Make selections in opened window:
      a) select 'v4.00' (for the moment) as official storage of calibration and configuration
         subdetectors files;
      b) push "Accept creation..." button if you want to copy subsystem specific calib/config
         files into your local (.../amsjobwd) directory. This gives you more flexibility
	 in calib.files manipulation (checking quality, comparison,...), you can later
	 (in JobSubmitter-session) select which calib.files('Offic'/Private' or from DB) to use
	 for given job;
      c) If above "Accept.." button is pressed you can select subsystems whose calib.files you
         want to copy (TRK,TRD and RICH buttons are not activated for the moment);
      d) select SessionType ("Install" is already selected as default);  
     
      e) push "Start" when ready (require few seconds to finish the job)
     
      f) push "Exit" to leave installation(InstallLog.date_stamp file will be created) in
         your MyJobSubmDir;
     
            ***** How to use *****
     
     'cd' to your  MyJobSubmDir
     run 'StartJobSubmitter' script
     
     In opened main window select Session-type (bottom/right of window, one of 3) and "Start".
  At the left part of window you will get set of buttons and small entry(or pulldown menu) 
  yellow windows. On the top you can check your main environment settings inside of  
  "GeneralInfo/Settings" frame. This frame includes also default DataCards file manipulation
  buttons(if you created new file(in workdir by "MakeNew") you can "Restore" it using default 
  one in your CVS-dir, or copy ("Commit") this new file to your CVS-dir; now your private s/w
  is ready for standard ams-commit procedure);
   
     On the right part of the main window you see big sub-window to display the program messages.
  
    At the middle/left you have "Setup new job" frame + empty grey area. You should select
  one of 12 data cards (DCs) groups (TOF,ACC,...,MCgen (if simulation session was selected)). 
  The pushed button stay pressed and orange. Available DC variables settings are displayed
  instead of previously mentioned gray area. You can change the displayed settings 
  (if nesessary). DCs may have upto 3 pages when available settings are not fit into single
  page(click "Page1(2,3)" button to switch between pages). 
  Currently only few DCs have 2nd page. If you are in "MCDataSimu" session you have 2 global
  pages selected by "RECO/SIMU" button (to the left from "Page" button.). By default 
  "SIMU"-page is displayed first. To set reconstruction related settings - click "SIMU"-button.
  It will change the name to "RECO" and change page. If after some changes on given page you
  decide to go back to the default settings - push "Reset2DefPar". Here default settings
  mean the ones defined in file 'DCDefPars.txt' sitting in your MyJobSubmDir (copy of the
  file sitting in your MyCVSTopDir/ut/jsubmitter and created durung installation). Later 
  (or now) you can replace copied 'DCDefPars.txt' file with new one containing your current 
  settings by pushing "MakeNewDCDefF" button (orange color). To go back to original version
  (in MyCVSTopDir/ut/jsubmitter) you need to copy it (for the moment) by hands to MyJobSubmDir. 
  
    Below 'settings' area you have line of buttons. Push "ConfirmPars" wnen you finished changes,
  push "CreateJScript"  and "EditJScript" if you want to see/edit created 'UnivJScript' file
  created in your working directory(MyJobSubmDir). This is the normal AMS script to run gbatch.
  Next "Batch(Inter)Job" button select 'batch' or 'interactive' mode ov running. Use the last 
  one if you want just check your script and selected DCs parameters on small statistics.
  
    Next (if you initially selected 'RealDataReco' mode) select run numbers (dates) range of
  desired DAQ-files in area below. You do not need type in both run# and related Date value. 
  Only single value - convertion will be done automatically at the next step. Now push 
  "Confirm Run/Date" and then push "ScanDaqDir" to search for files in desired range over 
  official AMS DAQ-files storage area. See message window for information on search results. 
  You can repeat daq-files selection again. You can sort found files by pushing 
  "EditRunList(AftScan)" button (new dialog window will be opened).
    
    After you are satisfied with DAQ-files selection, change parameters displayed below
  ('Event/job', 'queue' name, 'host'(if you want some particular one), 'Ncpus' and 'SetupName'
  ( now only 'AMS02PreAss' is available). Finally confirm selection by pushing "SetupJob" and 
  submit the job by "SubmitJob" button. As usually check message area for information.
   
    To see the status of all submitted jobs - push "CheckJobsStat" button in "SessionControl"
  frame and inspect the list in opened window. Here you can also delete submitted or running
  job(s) by clicking on the related line in the list and pushing "Kill job" button.
  
    To see the list of finished jobs(their log-files) - push "JobOutpControl" button. In the
  opened window you can analyse log-files and delete bad ones (you have status in the last 
  column as some indication, 3=good means that you just processed more than 1 event, that is
  your job does not crashed just after the it started). Click "Finish" button when you finished
  inspection and cleanup. This action will really delete marked as bad files and move good 
  ones to your standard store MyJobSubmDir/rdlogfiles(or mclogfiles). Push "QuitSession" to 
  leave session of initially selected SessType(session log-file will be created and copied to
  one of two '/*logfiles' directories).
  
    Push "Exit" button (at the very right/bottom) to go away or select new Session Type and 
  repeat all described steps. Unfinished jobs will continue to run and you can inspect them
  next time you run StartJobSubmitter.
  
    If root files creation have to be requested for particular job, you can (if you wish)
  specify subdir of MyRootfDir/RD(MC)-directory in related yellow window of 
  "General Info/Settings" frame at the main window top/left. This subdir will be created 
  automatically when you submit such job.
  
    Be careful typing the numbers and names in yellow entry windows instead of proposed
  (default) values - follow the presence (or absence) of "." and "'" signs of punctuation !!!
      
                                            Good luck, wait for comments,
