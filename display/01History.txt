v1997.12.11	Ping Yeh
  - Add "Two Views" mode per request of Vitali.  Currently those 2 views are
    displayed side by side and they are both stretched.  But users can stretch
    them back manually.
  - Added the first "AMS" menu for printing PostScript with particle info
    (This is tricky: event info is implemented with TGXW::DrawText() for
     fast update, but then it can't be printed to PostScript.  For this
     I added one "AMS" menu with only one item "save as canvas.ps", which
     calls AMSCanvas::SaveCB() which in turn inserts particle info before
     calling TPad::SaveAs(). )
  - Added title "Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer".   
  - default now is to show event status so user doesn't need to manually toggle
  - now detector is not too small anymore by turning off "AMSG1"
  - move run/event number to lower left corner and event status to
    lower right corner.
  - put a switch "Used Hits" (status 32) for tracker hits that are used 
    in tracks.
  - use Shuwei's hierarchy geometry tree (instead of g2root output which 
    have almost all TNodes in the same level under AMSG1).


v1997.12.07	Ping Yeh
  - use root v1.03/08 ( with -IROOT10308 ).
  - include geometry.
  - prototype of Shuwei Ye's AMSKeyNode class to set color/visibility of
    TNodes.
  - create AMSCanvas class to learn more about TCanvas and do things specially
    for AMS only.  Now it is almost dummy.
  - create TRadioButton and TSwitch classes.
  - 6 switches on the display to set on/off drawing of SiHit, ToFCluster,
    CTCCluster, Track, Particle and geometry.
  - can keep track of user's rotation of the view angle.  But it doesn't
    work when geometry is drawn.  Need further understanding.
  - Move AMSDisplay into libAMS.so and remove libAMSg.so so we have only
    one library.


1997.12.02 Ping Yeh	Keep m_ErrPosition[3] in AMSSiHit for real size
			because the underlying size in AMS3DCluster need 
			magnification for visual effects.
1997.12.02 Ping Yeh	Implement class AMS3DCluster : public TMarker3DBox
			to replace AMSFruit.  Now all cluster classes (ToF, 
			SiHit, CTC) inherit AMS3DCluster.
			AMS3DCluster::SetPoints(), 
			AMS3DCluster::DistancetoPrimitive() are tested okay.
1997.12.02 Ping Yeh	Increase MaxSiHits to 300.  When there are more SiHits
			then allowed the display will go crazy.  It is for 
			efficiency that I use TClonesArray which doesn't grow 
			dynamically.
1997.12.01 Ping Yeh	Add Debugger class
1997.11.30 Ping Yeh	Fix THelix range bug (negative dt -> positive)
			Background is changed to white for better printing
1997.11.28 Ping Yeh	Show correct run number and event number
1997.11.13 Ping Yeh	version 0 of prototype
