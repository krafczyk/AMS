1998.11.08      Shuwei YE
  - Change AMSR_NtupleCommons.h to fit new format of ntuple used for GSI data.

1998.10.06      Shuwei YE
  - Fix a bug concerning SiHit position.
  - Set correct bending direction of Particle in case beta<0 since its
    theta/phi are set correctly now.
  - Change to use sqrt(dEdx) for the height of TMarker3DBox, i.e. SiHit and
    ToFCluster.
  - Enable ntuple filename with Uppercase letter. Add chopt of "P" in HROPEN
    to preserve the case of ntuple filename.

1998.09.22      Shuwei YE
  - Fix a bug in AMSR_Display::DrawView. "m_Geometry->Draw()" will create
    a new TView instead on the existing one which is not expected.
  - Add some protections in main program
  - Add platform checking in Makefile

1998.08.17      Shuwei YE
  - Update to suit ROOT-v2.00 by Vitali Choutko
  - IBM/AIX support
  - Add some useful features such as "GotoRunEvent", "OpenDataFile" and
    "IdleTimer" setting to enable user to display only events survived the
     cuts in IdleHandle.C
  - Implement direct reading of ntuple format.
  - Change the style of arguement feeding for "amsed".
  - Disable display the first event for each opened file. The first event will
    be shown only if IdleTimer is not set, e.g. zero or negative Idle time.
    So the first event would be exceptional in the selected event display.
  - Write an uniform Makefile for both platforms of Alpha/OSF1 and IBM/AIX.

1998.01.10	Ping Yeh
  - Accept one command line argument in standalone version as the data file 
    to read
  - Merge with mods done by Vitali (AMSAntiCluster* and SelectEvent())

1997.12.22	Ping Yeh
  - A test of TFileSelectionDialog shows it is necessary to copy
    MOTIF_FileSelectionDialog.cxx and TFileSelectionDialog.h locally
    to make it work.  Otherwise it shows segmentation violation ---
    an indication of mis-compiled library?

1997.12.18	Ping Yeh
  - Make the standalone version, but no way to select data file yet.

1997.12.17	Ping Yeh
  - Improve the algorithm of AMS3DCluster::DistancetoPrimitive().  Now use
    d = cos(theta)*x + sin(theta)*y and   dmin < d < dmax for all 3 sets
    of parallel line segments to determine whether mouse is inside the box.

v1997.12.11	Ping Yeh
  - Add "Two Views" mode per request of Vitali.  Currently those 2 views are
    displayed side by side and they are both stretched.  But users can stretch
    them back manually.
  - Added the first "AMS" menu for printing PostScript with particle info
    (This is tricky: event info is implemented with TGXW::DrawText() for
     fast update, but then it can't be printed to PostScript.  For this
     I added one "AMS" menu with only one item "save as canvas.ps", which
     calls AMSCanvas::SaveCB() which in turn inserts particle info before
     calling TPad::SaveAs(). )
  - Added title "Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer".   
  - default now is to show event status so user doesn't need to manually toggle
  - now detector is not too small anymore by turning off "AMSG1"
  - move run/event number to lower left corner and event status to
    lower right corner.
  - put a switch "Used Hits" (status 32) for tracker hits that are used 
    in tracks.
  - use Shuwei's hierarchy geometry tree (instead of g2root output which 
    have almost all TNodes in the same level under AMSG1).


v1997.12.07	Ping Yeh
  - use root v1.03/08 ( with -IROOT10308 ).
  - include geometry.
  - prototype of Shuwei Ye's AMSKeyNode class to set color/visibility of
    TNodes.
  - create AMSCanvas class to learn more about TCanvas and do things specially
    for AMS only.  Now it is almost dummy.
  - create TRadioButton and TSwitch classes.
  - 6 switches on the display to set on/off drawing of SiHit, ToFCluster,
    CTCCluster, Track, Particle and geometry.
  - can keep track of user's rotation of the view angle.  But it doesn't
    work when geometry is drawn.  Need further understanding.
  - Move AMSDisplay into libAMS.so and remove libAMSg.so so we have only
    one library.


1997.12.02 Ping Yeh	Keep m_ErrPosition[3] in AMSSiHit for real size
			because the underlying size in AMS3DCluster need 
			magnification for visual effects.
1997.12.02 Ping Yeh	Implement class AMS3DCluster : public TMarker3DBox
			to replace AMSFruit.  Now all cluster classes (ToF, 
			SiHit, CTC) inherit AMS3DCluster.
			AMS3DCluster::SetPoints(), 
			AMS3DCluster::DistancetoPrimitive() are tested okay.
1997.12.02 Ping Yeh	Increase MaxSiHits to 300.  When there are more SiHits
			then allowed the display will go crazy.  It is for 
			efficiency that I use TClonesArray which doesn't grow 
			dynamically.
1997.12.01 Ping Yeh	Add Debugger class
1997.11.30 Ping Yeh	Fix THelix range bug (negative dt -> positive)
			Background is changed to white for better printing
1997.11.28 Ping Yeh	Show correct run number and event number
1997.11.13 Ping Yeh	version 0 of prototype
