/*! \mainpage AMS Data Access Manual

The standard AMS reconstruction output is a 
  <a href="http://root.cern.ch"> ROOT </a> file, in which
  <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TTree.html#TTree:description"> 
TTree </a>

 We have identified several possible ways to analyze these data:

<ul>
      <li> A compiled analysis with static or shared  libraries.
      You can find more at  \subpage  compsha 
</ul>

<ul>      <li> An interpreted analysis with the <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/Cint.html">
           CINT </a> is also possible as depicted in \subpage cintana
</ul>
<ul>
      <li> A compiled/interactive  analysis with the TSelector mode. You can find more at \subpage stlv
                      
</ul>

<ul>
      <li> (New) A compiled analysis with static libraries in a parallel mode  You can find more information in the link
</ul>

/*! \page compsha "Compiled Shared or Static"
Here there is an example of a simple looper that scans the data
it can be compiled versus static or dynamic AMS libraries
The files are in the GBATCH source in the directory examples/verysimple


This is an example of the code.
\include analyze.C

This is a Makefile that shows how to compile it
\include Makefile

/*! \page cintana "Interactive analysis (CINT)"
Here there is an example of a simple looper that scans the data
it can be run from the ROOT propmt.
The files are in the GBATCH source in the directory examples/verysimple_CINT

This is the macro to pre-load the AMS libraries
\include LoadAMSLibs.C

This is an example of the code.
\include analyze_CINT.C

This is the macro that shows how to run it
\include run.analyze_CINT.C
*/

/*! \page stlv TSelector Analysis 
This page is devoted to an analysis example using the TSelector approach 

This is an example of the code
\include daqePG_simple.C

and of a macro to run it


This is an example of the code
\include r.daqePG_simple.C
