/*! \example select_entries.doc
 *  The program below (select_entries.C) illustrates how to write 
 *  your selected events into a new AMS Root file. 
 *    - To run it: root -b -q select_entries.C
 *
 *  The example also illustrates how to write/use only a subsample
 *  of branches (Header+Particle), thus saving some disk space.
 *  If you just want to write all branches, comment
 *  the code between "BEGIN of block" and "END of block".
 *
 *  \include select_entries.C
