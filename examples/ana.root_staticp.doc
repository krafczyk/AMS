 *  The program below (daqe_mt.C) illustrates a way to analyze AMS Root 
 *  files in a parallel way. The parallelization is done on the level of root files, and not events. 
 *    - To compile and link it  you can use  script 
 *                -  link_mt.sh daqe_mt  
 *    
 *    - To run it use $AMSWD/daqe_mt -tthreadnumber -ffile_output_name  
 * 
 *     -  where threadnumber is the integer between 1 and number of cores of a given machine. You should avoid to use threadnumber>2 on a public ams machine. 
 *      
*
*The performance of the multithreaded application is not linear w/r number of threads as usually driven by i/o. 
*
* The golden number of threads is therefore often close to number_of_different_filesystems_used +1 . 
*
*The elapsed time performance gain may be as high as 300% for 4-6 thread version w/r single threaded one.              
 *
*  -    Note that this mode is primarily designed for the massive data analysis with number of root files at least O(100) 
*
 *    - Note that the program is prepared to be run in batch mode. 
 *
 *    - Also, it does not work with RFIO files for the time being.
