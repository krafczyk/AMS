gcc64-44  (slc6)

the corresponding patch is available in  /afs/cern.ch/ams/Offline/AMSsoft/root-v5-34-09.patch
see also RelaseNotes.VC  for build options and what was changed




the corresponding root libraries are installed in

Comments for these root versions release


1.Xrootd  is now only support shared libraries.

  the corresponding xrootd 3-2-7 are installed in

  /afs/cern.ch/ams/local2/opt/xrootd-xxx


2.LZMA compression gives better compression w/r libz , but slower algorithm.

  the compression level=2  gives 10 to 15 % of the root file size, while having small cpu overhead
  which is the default now. 

  IMPORTANT  we are going to change compression in Data production soon (Date will be announced)

  To have backward support the LZMA compression had been added in 5.27 icc64 only

  /afs/cern.ch/exp/ams/Offline/root/Linux/527.icc64.lzma

  NB this version will be used after issuing source  /Offline/vdev/install/amsvar


   Previous version is available after by issuing
     source /Offline/vdev/install/amsvar.nolzma

  You might need the version above if you are using dynamically linking to the above root shared libraries (not recommended). To resolve the problem (forever) you need to recompile your exec (using libroot.a)  or make sure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH included same library used for linking (this is general problem with root as the latter does not support shared library schema evolution via libName.so.version)
 



  
  Please report all the problems in using it to vitali.choutko@cern.ch


 

3. AMS libraries/exec for new versions 
    
are being installed on /Offline/vdev/.../linuxx8664icc645.34
                       /Offline/vdev/.../linuxx8664gcc645.34



4. We are going to switch AMS production using root version 5-34-09 soon  (Date will be announced)
