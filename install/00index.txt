To create standalone simulation/reconstruction program (without db) use:

either ( if developper == use cvs before)
 batch         clmake Mgbatch or Mopt *)
 interactive   clmake Mgxint  (batch program should be created first)

or (user == use of $AMSDataDir../vdev only) 
 batch         Cgbatch user or  $AMSDataDir../vdev/exe/osf1/gbatch.exe 
 interactive   $AMSDataDir../vdev/exe/osf1/gxint.exe 


Instructions how to create & run db connected batch simulation program
are in ../doc/dbase_objy.doc





*) Makedepend doesnot work properly on alpha ( after OS upgrade).
  The reasons are not yet unsderstood.
  A workaround is remove first all object files from ../bin/osf1
  and then compile/link as usual thru clmake.
