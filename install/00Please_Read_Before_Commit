Rules for devloppers:

Before commit please insure that:

i. You have increased by one corr classdef in root.h provided you have changed class content
ii.You have increased by one _buildno in commonsi.C provided you have changed in PRODUCTION branch

iii.

./build_all  shows no errors 
./load_all   shows no erors
./run_all
./test_all    shows no errors

iv
 AMS Event Display works on produced root files and shows meaningful pictures.

Nota bene:

A good machine where to try it is scamfs1. The suggested shell is tcsh. A working procedure is:

ssh scamsfs1
cd /tmp
mkdir whatever
cd whatever
cvs co AMS
cd AMS
cd install
./build_all > & build_all.log
...

Remember that if AMSWD is set this will be 'honored' and the build_all will put the results there.
If this is not set the compilation will build inside the actual working directory but then AMSWD is rewuired for the next steps.
Another approach is passing the AMSWD as parameter. For example you can do:

./build_all  `pwd`/../
./load_all  `pwd`/../
./run_all  `pwd`/../
./test_all  `pwd`/../
